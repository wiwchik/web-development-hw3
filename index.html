'Cisco was reached at seven in the morning; and an hour later the dormitory was transformed into an ordinary car, and the travellers could observe the picturesque beauties of the mountain region through which they were steaming. The railway track wound in and out among the passes, now approaching the mountain-sides, now suspended over precipices, avoiding abrupt angles by bold curves, plunging into narrow defiles, which seemed to have no outlet. The locomotive, its great funnel emitting a weird light, with its sharp bell, and its cow-catcher extended like a spur, mingled its shrieks and bellowings with the noise of torrents and cascades, and twined its smoke among the branches of the gigantic pines.”

                      <p>"For one day longer the despatches continued to come from New York.  Then they, too, ceased. The man who had sent them, perched in his lofty  building, had either died of the plague or been consumed in the great  conflagrations he had described as raging around him. And what had  occurred in New York had been duplicated in all the other cities. It was  the same in San Francisco, and Oakland, and Berkeley. By Thursday the  people were dying so rapidly that their corpses could not be handled,  and dead bodies lay everywhere. Thursday night the panic outrush for  the country began. Imagine, my grandsons, people, thicker than the  salmon-run you have seen on the Sacramento river, pouring out of the  cities by millions, madly over the country, in vain attempt to escape  the ubiquitous death. You see, they carried the germs with them. Even  the airships of the rich, fleeing for mountain and desert fastnesses,  carried the germs.</p>

She escaped from the hordes of Thark with a strange creature of another world, only to fall into the hands of the Warhoons.
